            <h1>Who am I</h1>
            
            <p>I am a 26-year-old guy who is very interested about anything related to computers and computing technology.</p>
            <p>I have studied mechanical engineering in the University of Oulu since 2015, but I discovered my true passion 
                in computer science around 2017. Before that I was interested about computers at some level but university course about 
                working principle of 8-bit computer lit truly my passion.
            </p>
            <p>Fortunately computer science is very tightly integrated to mechanical engineering and I have been able 
                to study IT stuff along side university studies of mechanical engineering and thus gathered pretty wide 
                profession.
            </p>
            <p><b>At the moment I am looking for subject for my master's thesis. Master's thesis is the last thing left before I am able to graduate. 
                I am also looking for a job that is related to computer science.</b>
            </p>
            <p>I would surely be very wanted employee for area of mechanical engineering, becouse of my mechanical engineering + 
                computer science combo. I would be obvious choice for example automation related tasks.
            </p>
            <p>My primary goal is not to get a job in mechanical engineering field, but rather find a job that is related to computer 
                science. If I can find that kind of job from mechanical engineering, that is of course a good thing, but I would be 
                also very interested about working purely in software.
            </p>

            <h2>As an employee</h2>
            <p>As an employee I am efficient and I like to be working with something constantly. I can work well all by myself or 
                as part of the team. If needed I can take lead in a small group.
            </p>
            <p>As a person I am calm and kind and I am able to work with all kinds of people.</p>
