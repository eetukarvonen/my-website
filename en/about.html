            <h1>Who am I</h1>
            
            <p>I am a 29-year-old guy who is very interested about anything related to computers and computing technology.</p>
            <p>I studied mechanical engineering in the University of Oulu in 2015-2021, but I discovered my true passion 
                in computer science around 2017. Before that I was interested about computers at some level but university course about 
                working principle of 8-bit computer lit truly my passion.
            </p>
            <p>Fortunately computer science is very tightly integrated to mechanical engineering and I have been able 
                to study IT stuff along side university studies of mechanical engineering and thus gathered pretty wide 
                profession.
            </p>
            <p>2021 I wrote a master's thesis which was about developing a computer vision system.</p>
            <p>I want computing technology to be my main area of focus in the future as well, but I would be happy to 
                avail my mechanical engineering skills combined with computing technology.
            </p>

            <h2>As an employee</h2>
            <p>I am entrepreneur-type, efficient and I like to be working with something constantly. I can work well all by myself or 
                as part of the team. If needed I can take lead in a small group.
            </p>
            <p>As a person I am calm and kind and I am able to work with all kinds of people.</p>
